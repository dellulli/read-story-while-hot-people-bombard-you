        <div class="title"><strong>Lamb to the Slaughter</strong></div>
        <div class="author"><strong>by Roald Dahl</strong></div>
        <div class="story">
            <p>Mary Maloney waits for her husband, Patrick, to come home from work. “Hullo, darling,” she says cheerfully, taking his coat and making his drink. She sits across from him, sewing, watching him sip the drink. “Tired, darling?” she asks. “Yes,” he replies. “I’m tired.”</p>
            <p>She offers to make dinner or fetch his slippers, but he rejects her offers. She watches him closely, sensing something is wrong. Finally, he tells her to sit down. “Listen,” he says, “I’ve got something to tell you.” As he speaks, Mary sits frozen, staring at him in shock. “So there it is,” he finishes, “and I know it’s kind of a bad time to be telling you, but there wasn’t any other way.”</p>
            <p>Her mind goes numb. She whispers, “I’ll get the supper.” Patrick doesn’t stop her this time. She goes to the cellar, grabs the first thing she touches—a frozen leg of lamb—and walks back up. She sees him standing by the window. “For God’s sake,” he says, not turning around. “Don’t make supper for me. I’m going out.”</p>
            <p>Something snaps in Mary. She swings the frozen leg of lamb high in the air and brings it down hard on the back of his head. He stands for a moment, swaying, before crashing to the floor. She stares at his body, feeling cold and detached. “All right,” she thinks, “So I’ve killed him.”</p>
            <p>Mary begins to think quickly. As the wife of a detective, she knows the consequences. She puts the lamb in the oven, washes her hands, and tidies herself. She practices a smile in the mirror, then goes to the grocery store. “Hullo, Sam,” she says, smiling at the grocer. “Patrick’s decided he’s tired and doesn’t want to eat out tonight. I need some potatoes and a can of peas.”</p>
            <p>She returns home, humming a little tune, and calls out, “Patrick!” She acts shocked when she sees his body, drops her groceries, and starts crying. Then she calls the police. “Quick! Come quick! Patrick’s dead!” she sobs.</p>
            <p>When the detectives arrive, they question her as she tells them she was at the store when it happened. The officers search for the murder weapon. “Get the weapon, and you’ve got the man,” one of them says.</p>
            <p>Sergeant Noonan notices the oven is still on and the lamb cooking inside. “You know that oven of yours is still on?” he says. “Oh dear me!” she exclaims. “Why don’t you eat that lamb? It’s just right by now.”</p>
            <p>The men, hungry and tired, agree to eat. As they chew, one detective says, “That’s a hell of a big club the guy must’ve used to hit poor Patrick… Probably right under our very noses.” In the other room, Mary giggles softly.</p>
